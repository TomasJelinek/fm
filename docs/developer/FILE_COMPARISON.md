# File comparison and manual input

`Ctrl+Shift+C`, F10's Compare files and the shared toolbar invoke the same comparator.
The action remains available without a file target: it can ask for both inputs.

## Planned comparator settings

Configurable comparator associations are **planned**, not implemented or qualified
by the current runtime. The [design](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-13-comparator-associations-design.md),
[UI wireframes](../superpowers/specs/2026-11-13-comparator-associations-ui.md) and
[implementation plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-11-13-comparator-associations.md)
cover ordered BOTH-basename routing to existing built-ins or a trusted external
program. The current pairing and ownership behavior below remains implemented.

## Pair resolution

`Presenter::file_compare_launch` captures immutable `FileCompareSource` snapshots,
never enumerates selections or accesses files. Two active-panel selections retain
their visible order. Otherwise File A represents the left panel and File B the
right. An explicit opposite selection wins; with none, the worker resolves a unique
exact native basename in the captured visible listing. An unrelated opposite cursor
is never substituted. Loading/unstable selection, parent, directory, virtual/archive
or ambiguous rows do not supply implicit native paths. Plugin preferences must be
loaded before opening a session so disabled providers cannot be bypassed.

`midnight-compare-engine/file_choice.rs` preserves the unambiguous part of a pair
and returns `Output::ChooseFiles(FileChoice)` for everything else. Empty paths mean
unknown inputs. The session stays alive for explicit `Input::Compare([PathBuf; 2])`
or `Input::Browse { side, paths, owner }`. Invalid paths, missing/nonregular files or
comparison errors return the form with both draft paths intact. Native paths are
absolute and literal: no shell, quotes, expansion, cwd inference or writes.

## Ownership and threading

Production composition supplies `Service::with_native_capture` with the shared
installed-native-filesystem callback used by F3 and thumbnails. Both automatically
resolved and manually supplied inputs are captured on the comparator worker. A
provider error returns to the input form; it never tries a direct native opener.
The callback receives live cancellation, checked again before content use. Session
capacity remains reserved until an in-flight callback returns after cancellation.
The standalone `Service::new` constructor retains its default capture behavior for
embedding/tests; the application explicitly uses the injected provider constructor.
See [native media verification](../verification/2026-11-08-native-media-capture.md).

The app injects its existing `Arc<dyn PathPickerService>` into `Service`; it also
provides the existing platform-specific `native_path_picker_owner` to the UI.
Windows uses its Common Item Dialog and Linux the desktop file chooser portal.
Only the backend calls these implementations. The comparator permits two sessions,
one worker and one picker at a time per session, with bounded input/latest-output
mailboxes. Closing cancels both the comparison and the picker's shared cancellation
token. Normal picker cancellation retains the draft and returns to the form.

The form disables editing, browsing and Compare while a request is pending, but
retains Cancel/native close. This prevents an old picker result overwriting newer
drafts. Selection results cannot be replaced by resize/status traffic: the choice
loop consumes geometry silently until another explicit user request. Retry retains
the latest viewport geometry/revision. Large file/selection cleanup remains on the
worker. The UI stores original PathBuf values separately from lossy display strings;
an unchanged field keeps the exact native bytes/UTF-16. An edited field explicitly
supplies a new Unicode path. No MAX_PATH buffer is introduced.

## Presentation and tests

The same native comparator window hosts the File A / File B form and the resulting
text/image comparison. It retains main-window placement/size, native resizing/moving,
Escape and the close button. Each input has Browse; Enter submits both nonempty
fields. Short forms center within the window, scroll at 320×200 and keep Compare and
Cancel outside the scrolling area. File fields own their editing/navigation keys.

Tests cover existing automatic Unicode/raw-native pairing, partial physical order,
empty/ambiguous/pending panel inputs, repeated invalid paths and retry, unchanged
source contents, picker thread/owner, cancellation, invalid picker results, raw path
presentation, real Slint field input, busy-state duplicate prevention and compact
rendering. See `midnight-compare-engine/src/file_choice_tests.rs` and
`midnight-compare-ui/tests/file_choice.rs`.

Salamander reference: `src/plugins/filecomp/dialogs.cpp` (`CCompareFilesDialog`) and
`src/plugins/filecomp/lang/lang.rc` (`IDD_COMPAREFILES`). The two-path/Browse behavior
is adopted; no C++ implementation, artwork or MAX_PATH restriction is copied.
