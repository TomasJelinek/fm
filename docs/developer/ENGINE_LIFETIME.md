# Engine ownership and retirement

This is an internal Rust API, separate from the independently versioned plugin APIs.
Reserve cleanup before constructing provider-bearing services:

```rust,ignore
let lifetime = midnight_engine::Engine::lifetime()?;
// Construct native providers only after the fallible worker startup succeeds.
let engine = midnight_engine::Engine::new(lifetime, filesystem, events);
let task = runtime.spawn(engine.run(commands));
```

`Engine::run` synchronously owns the command receiver and complete pinned execution
future before returning `EngineRun`. Dropping an unstarted Engine or unpolled/aborted
run transfers its protected owners to a plain cleanup thread, independently of Tokio.
Normal completion acknowledges retirement. No UI or executor destructor joins that
thread. The existing application shutdown grace period remains bounded.

## Capacity and ownership

One engine reserves a domain with 74 payload slots and three reusable waiter tokens:

| Owners | Slots |
| --- | ---: |
| Copy/Move accepted work | 32 |
| Mutation accepted work, including Delete | 32 |
| Serialized intake for each actor | 2 |
| Copy and mutation service contexts | 2 |
| Drag state, accepted drop registry and one serial backlog drain | 3 |
| Engine run, command receiver and shared panel snapshots | 3 |

Native drag admission uses Copy's existing 32 permits. It does not add another queue.
A reservation is acquired before accepting owned payloads and remains occupied until
actual destruction finishes, including blocked native cleanup. No thread is started
per destructor and no fallback executes cleanup inline on an executor.

Copy retains payload, terminal receipt, mutation permit and capacity in one guard.
Prepared mutations keep native pins before captured provider owners in destruction
order. Guarded state remains owned while waiting for output delivery, confirmation,
predecessors and mutation admission. Moving a raw value out of a guard is worker-only;
its lease must remain until destruction or immediate transformation into a new guard.

The guarded command inbox closes admission and drains until previously acquired send
permits are released or deliver their command. Late admitted commands therefore retire
on the same worker. A producer that holds such a permit forever can stall this bounded
cleanup domain; it cannot grow replacement capacity or block the UI's Drop call.
Similarly, an arbitrary blocked provider destructor has no guaranteed completion time.
One unwinding destructor is isolated; Rust's double-panic/process-abort rules still apply.

## Qualification boundary

This protects the outer run, command inbox, Copy/Move/mutation handoffs, shared snapshots
and drag-owned captures. It is not a blanket guarantee for every independently spawned
engine task: service clones and request payloads in Find, checksum and custom-command
actors still require the follow-up documented in
[the ownership review](../verification/2026-11-12-engine-lifetime-review.md).
[LIFE-01](../IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG.md#lifecycle-follow-up-found-on-12-november) remains open.
The plugin ABI, operation authority, confirmation and checksum policy are unchanged.
